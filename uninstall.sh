# TMS VPN Complete Uninstaller Script
# Removes CLI engine, Menu Bar App, runtime state, configuration and the
# PSK/password entries in Keychain.
#
# CLI-side cleanup is delegated to `vpn uninstall -y` — the one place that
# knows every file it owns, disconnects gracefully (restoring routes/DNS
# and ending the PPP session) and deletes the Keychain secrets. Run this as
# the user who installed vpn, not with sudo: the Keychain and ~/.config/vpn
# belong to that user; the CLI raises privilege itself where needed.
