// Package sysbin is the single list of macOS system tools this client
// shells out to, by absolute path. Never a bare command name: much of this
// runs under privilege.Elevate (effective root) in a setuid binary, and a
// bare name would be resolved via $PATH, which the invoking user fully
// controls — classic setuid PATH hijacking.
