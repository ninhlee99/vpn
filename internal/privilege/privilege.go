// Package privilege implements the standard setuid-root safety pattern:
// drop to the real (invoking) user by default, and only regain root for
// the specific, minimal operations that actually need it (opening a utun
// device, binding UDP/500, running route/ifconfig/networksetup) — never
// leaving the process privileged longer than one such operation needs.
//
// This is what makes it safe to install this binary setuid-root so `vpn
// connect` etc. don't need `sudo` on every invocation: without dropping by
// default, every subcommand (including ones that just read local config,
// like `profile add`) would run fully as root for its whole lifetime,
// which is unnecessary privilege the process doesn't need and shouldn't
// hold. macOS credentials are process-wide (unlike Linux, where a raw
// setuid(2) call only affects the calling OS thread — see
// https://github.com/golang/go/issues/1435 — that bug does not apply
// here), so a plain syscall.Seteuid from any goroutine correctly changes
// privilege for the whole process on Darwin.

// executable (and, without this check, root-capable) for *every* local
// account on the machine, not just the person who ran install.sh — call
// this as the very first thing in main(), before Drop or any subcommand
// dispatch, so a different user can't invoke this binary at all. Enforce it
// only when this executable is actually setuid-root (euid 0, real uid
// non-root). A downloaded candidate binary is deliberately run as an
// ordinary user for `vpn version` before installation; it cannot read the
// root-only OwnerFile and has no privilege to protect, so rejecting it would
// break installer/update validation on a machine with vpn already installed.
